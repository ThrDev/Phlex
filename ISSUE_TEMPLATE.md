## ISSUE TEMPLATE

Please read over the [Notes/FAQ](Notes-FAQ) and [networking](Talking-To-The-Outside-World) sections before reporting an issue.

If your issue is not resolved, try to fill out the following as completely as possible. I'm not going to delete issues just because forms aren't filled out completely, but I will if you provide me no information whatsoever.

If submitting a feature request, these are not required.

#### 1. On what OS are you running Phlex?

#### 2. Are you using a new instance of XAMPP, or an existing webserver?

#### 2b. If not XAMPP, what WebServer stack are you using?

#### 3. Have you enabled the sockets module and ensured PHP has write-access to the directory containing Phlex?

#### 4. Have you followed the (networking)[Talking-To-The-Outside-World] section?

#### 5. If you're having issues with a specific command, please note the timestamp in the web UI, and take a look at Phlex and Phlex_error.log files.  Paste anything that looks related as well.

*BE SURE TO CHANGE ANY LINES CONTAINING API TOKENS OR OTHER PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION*

#### 6. What are the last six digits of your server's API Token? (Settings -> Phlex)
